# Mock-Up Sketches

## Sketch 1:

[altPresentationImg1](PresentationImg6.png)

A very simple outline of what the timeline might look like with the years on the left side of the screen.
On the far right hand of the screen we have mini-graphs that aren't as significant but may be useful to know.

## Sketch 2

[altPresentationImg2](PresentationImg5.png)

A variation of the first outline where instead of the years being in the left side, it's in the middle.
The left side of the screen shows the history at that year and the charts shown on the right side of the
timeline.

## Sketch 3

[altPresentationImg3](PresentationImg4.png)

Going back to the first sketch, with the timeline on the left, however the middle/right majority is represented with
the event information and graphs pertaining to that year. Also, the addition of a progressbar with the years
embedded into it so that use can track how far into the timeline they are in.

## Sketch 4

[altPresentationImg4](PresentationImg3.png)

This sketch consists of the timeline without the progress bar, but giving the user the option to jump to a major event.
In the case where the user would like to not scroll through the entire historical timeline and instead jump around
the timeline.

## Sketch 5

[altPresentationImg5](PresentationImg2.png)

This sketch consists of removing explicit jumps to parts of the timeline. The timeline on the left is available for 
the user to click on a certain dot to jump to that specific year, or choose to scroll through the timeline at the same time.
In a sense, it consolidates all of what we want into a more condensed version.

## Sketch 6

[altPresentationImg6](PresentationImg1.png)

This sketch consists of the addition of little graphs on the right side that will change dynamically
respective to the year as the user scrolls through the timeline. These graphs may represent what the
total global sales were for a publisher, platform, or even genre which may indicate which publisher, 
platform, or genre performed best for that year.
